# osrsping
This is just a fun project I decided to work on in my free time. It is ugly and buggy, but I'll keep improving on it as I learn more, 
provided I still have an interest in the project. The OldSchool RuneScape client does not report world ping, so I decided to write my own test clients.

#### How to use

The python client will open a window and automatically begin testing the ping to every world.
The reset button will eventually wipe out all of the results and force a retest, but currently does nothing useful.

The cmd script will open a command prompt and ask which world you would like to test. It then runs the ping test and asks if you would like to test another or quit.
